         <h1>What is cryptocurrnecy?</h1>
         <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies in which transactions are
           verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using
           cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.
        </p>
        <h2>Where did cryptocurrnecy begin?</h2>
        <p>The first cryptocurrnecy was created in 2008 by an individual who went
          by the pseudo name 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. They released Bitcoin, as a way
          to securely make decentralized transactions. Since then, there's been
          hundreds of new cryptocurrencies released such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA)
          and Litecoin (LTE).
